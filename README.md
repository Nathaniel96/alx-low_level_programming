ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my ALX Low Level Programming repository! This is where I keep all my code and notes from my time learning software engineering at ALX. ðŸ“š

ðŸ¤” What is Low Level Programming? Low Level Programming is the art of writing code that interacts directly with a computer's hardware. It involves working with concepts such as memory management, system calls, and assembly language. It's not for the faint of heart, but it's an essential skill for any software engineer who wants to understand how computers work at a deeper level. ðŸ’»

ðŸš€ Getting Started This repository contains directories for each topic covered in my ALX Low Level Programming course.
